👋 Hello, I'm Andres, also known as (Nymoout)! 🚀

Developer by day, dreamer by night. In my world, variables are like friends: always changing! 💻✨ When I'm not dealing with bugs, you can find me navigating the infinite universe of Stack Overflow.

Coffee lover ☕ and a fan of foreign keys in databases. Because even relationships in code can be complicated, but they always find a way to come together!

Night owl by choice, a competitor in the game of life. Java, Kotlin, C#, or C++? I choose all of the above! 💡 When I'm not coding, I'm exploring the vast world of geek memes and sci-fi movie references.

I turn lines of code into poetry, and errors into opportunities for better refactoring. 🌌 Join me on my quest for digital perfection and discover the geekier side of development!

So, ready for an adventure in the world of primary keys and pointers? Let's code the future! 🚀🎮
